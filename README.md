# Unhandled Error in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications:  missing error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

The issue is that the code attempts to fetch user data based on a provided ID, but lacks error handling for situations where the ID is invalid (e.g., non-existent user, improperly formatted ID). This can lead to unexpected behavior or server crashes.

The solution incorporates robust error handling, providing clear responses to the client in case of invalid IDs, which leads to improved stability and user experience.
